  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Hi! I am Susana.</p>
  <p>I am a Spanish marketer, developer wanna be and keen traveler. This year I finally took the decision of quiting my job and travel the job. </br>
  Some people called it "gap year" but I am going to called it "My disovery year".</p>
  <p>This blog is not only to follow my adventure, but to discover people, their stories and their cultures.</p>
  <p>If you would like to know a bit more about my day to day stories, you can follow my <a href="">Instagram account</a> or if you are more interesting in my professional journey, my <a href="">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

    <h1>Travelling</h1>
    <p>Travelling is one of my passions. I have been in the move since I was little and probably my mum has something to do with that.
    I love to discover different cultures and places. Talk with people and share life experiences. I would like to think I have travel a bit, but I still have lots of plaes to visit, including South America. And this needs to change...</p>

    <h1>Pofessional experience</h1>
    <p>I am a marketing Manager with more than 12 years of experience in digital marketing and offline. I started my professional career working in <a href="">Burson Marstellers</a>, a PR agency in Madrid, to move later to <a href="">Comunica+A</a> an advertising agency also in Madrid. </br>
      There, I specialised in POS, being part of the <a href="">Orange</a> shops rebranding. From catalogues an posters to contracts and phones packagings. Events, videos, benchmarking, etc. In an agency you become multitasking, you learn how to work under pressure, with tights dealines and how to deal with clients but also with providers and designers as well.</p>
      <p>But life is life, and I decided to move to London to start a new life experience and with that a work one too. And I entered in the digital world. Gamesys has been my company for the last 8 year and it is there where I adcquired most of my digital skills. </br>
        In this company I mastered the user lifecycle, from acquisiton to retention. I adquired experience in CRM, Content Management, Partnerships, Affiliation, Social Media, Retention,Aquisition.</p>
        <p>Besides, and following my moto of "Always learning" I did a master in Digital Marketing. But as well, became more and more interested on the tech side of the things... Probably after working with many developers during so many years. So, I decided to become a Certified Product Owner. </br>
        However, this wasn't enought and I decide to learn a bit of coding to create my own blog and who know... became a full time developer one day?.</p>
