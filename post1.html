<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>It's not the first time that I try to start a blog. My first one was like more than 12 years ago and it is live somewhere in the net. </br>
I have realised that I'm not the type of person that post every day and that I need to feel inspire to write. Who doesn't? </br>
So this blog is going to be not about where I am every single day or how to move around, where to find the best deals, etc. I consider there are too many places where you can find that information already. But I wan't to talk to you about the people I meet on my travels, their lifestyles, their intererst, how they live and how they find life.</p>
<p>My travel, and with it my blog, is going to formally start on March.</p>
